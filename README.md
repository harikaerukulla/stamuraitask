In this project I need to create a web app where you can add,delete or edit a task.task will have a titledescription ,date,and priority.if the webapp is opened in two browser tabs then any change done in one tab is synced in other tab.I need to create backend and frontend.the front end.

To run this application one needs to have xampp installed in their machine.First put all the files which are under frontend folder in htdocs folder of xampp.
And register is the database I have used.To restore the database create a folder "register" under "data" folder of "mysql" folder of "xampp" then copy all the files of register folder to the recently created folder.

Now use localhost://project/login.php to start running the application.
to make the application secure i used login and registration page.
I have attached the screenshots of the application for your reference.
